Contents
------------

The BORG SDSS data release is organised in the form of several "packages" (see below); each of them is related to some of our publications. These contain three-dimensional maps of the Universe, object catalogues, and IPython notebooks that permit to reproduce the results of our papers.

Please refer to the notebook in each of the packages for more information on the data and their use, as well as a list of the papers to cite.
